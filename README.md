# NNFL_Assignment_1

Building A Neural Network From Scratch:
In this assignment, you will build a neural network from scratch using NumPy. You will implement functions to build a neural network with as many layers as you want. You will also use this neural network to build a classifier for the Credit Approval Dataset after performing data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.

Overview of the Assignment:
The assignment asks you to complete several functions, with each function guiding you through the necessary steps to complete it. You will:

1. Preprocess the Credit Approval Dataset (like fill in missing values, split into test and train sets, etc).
2. Implement various activation functions taught in class.
3. Initialize the weight matrices and bias vectors of the neural network depending on its architecture.
4. Implement the forward propagation module.
5. Compute cross entropy loss function.
6. Implement the backward propagation module to compute gradients of loss function w.r.t. weights of the network.
7. With the help of batch gradient descent optimizer, update the weights of the neural network using gradients computed in the previous step.
8. Repeat steps 3-6 for several epochs to train the neural network on Credit Approval Dataset.
9. Report the accuracy of the neural network on test data.
